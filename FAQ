FAQ

Does this proceedure permanently decrypt my disk?

    No. It only sets up a filter, so that the linux system can see through the encryption.
    When you reboot, the filter is gone, and you have to recreate it. Save your dek.hex
    (and if necessary rev4.ko or rev16.ko). Better yet, backup your files before you
    turn the computer off.

Will it work in a virtual machine (VM) running linux?

    I don't know. No one has told me that it has worked for them. You will need to be
    able to access the WD drive, but some VM software do not allow that.

Will it work if I use a live linux USB?

    It's never guaranteed to work, but a live USB linux system is fine for this.

I have a PLX OSUF943SSE chip, and I can't find my keyblock. Now what?

    Did you use the findkeyblock.sh script?
    
    Maybe it's in the service-area modules. Try HDDSuperTool from
    
        http://www.sdcomputingservice.com/hddsupertool/download
    
    If you can't find the keyblock in the SA modules, it may be on one of the ROM chips
    of the USB-SATA bridge card. For that you will need an EEPROM reader.
    
    So far, no one has told me that they have successfully found the OSUF943SE keyblock
    in the SA modules or ROM chips. Only one person has told me that they found the keyblock
    at the end of the disk.

When about this error? "dd: /dev/sdd: cannot skip: Invalid argument"

    Did you take the drive out of the WD enclosure and put it in a computer or in a
    non-WD enclosure?

    Are you using the keyblock location for the correct disk size?
